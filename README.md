# Library Styles Sync
## Overview
sync shared text and layer styles from a Sketch Libary into the current document.

### Which Libraries does it sync from?
* It syncs styles from any libraries that you've inserted a symbol from

### How does it match styles?
* By name
  * if the style doesn't exist, it's created
  * if it does exist, it's overwritten
  
### Does sync work both ways?
No, sync is only one-way (from Library to document). Any changes to your document's shared styles will get overwritten next time you run the plugin.
